PR scoring parameter explanations:

lines_added: Number of lines of code added in the PR — indicates implementation size or feature work.
lines_removed: Number of lines removed in the PR — often signals refactor, cleanup, or simplification.
files_changed: Count of files modified in the PR — measures breadth and potential impact/risk.
commits: Number of commits in the PR — shows iteration; many small commits can be good, too many messy commits may be negative.
tests_added: Number of test cases or test files added with the PR — positive quality signal (unit/integration/other tests added).
review_comments: Number of review comments on the PR — higher counts often indicate issues or required rework (treated as a negative signal).
approvals: Number of reviewer approvals — positive signal showing peer review acceptance.
merge_time_days: Time in days from PR open to merge/close — shorter times usually indicate smoother reviews and integration.

Repo-level / aggregation parameters:

pr_count: Total PRs by the author (in the evaluated window) — activity volume.
commits_per_pr: Average commits per PR — workflow granularity indicator.
avg_merge_time_days: Average merge time across PRs — overall review/merge speed.
repo_stars: Repository star count — proxy for project visibility/popularity.
repo_forks: Repository fork count — proxy for community adoption and contribution interest.

Outputs:

avg_pr_score: Average per-PR score (0-100) computed from PR metrics.
repo_level_score: Score (0-100) computed from repo-level metrics.
final_score: Aggregated final score (0-100) combining avg_pr_score and repo_level_score.
